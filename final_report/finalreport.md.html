**Plant Buddy - Final Report**

Having a plant in your life has many benefits. It can help relieve stress, boost creativity, improve productivity, and a bunch of other benefits to one’s well-being and health. Yet, taking care of plants can be difficult. Different types of plants require different amounts of sunlight and water and it can be hard to remember the needs of each specific plant. In addition, life simply can get busy. Sometimes, you might forget to water your plant or forget when the last time you watered your plant was. You might also have left your plant out in the sun for too long, or not long enough. So many things can go wrong which can ultimately and unfortunately cause the plant to die. Don’t you wish there was an easy way to keep track of your plant's needs?

Introducing Plant Buddy, your new assistant in keeping your plants healthy and happy!

Functionality
===============================================================================
Users will mainly be interfacing with our project through a website. 


Plant Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On our website, users will be able to see all of their plant information. This plant information includes:

* Plant name (e.g. Patrick, Leafy, Greeny)
* Plant type (e.g Fern, Cactus, Snake Plant)
* Plant owner (e.g. timmyd@mit.edu, alexplantbuddy608@gmail.com)
* Sunlight intensity (pick from values Low, Medium, and High)
* Hours of sunlight needed
* Ideal temperature (in Celsius)
* Ideal soil moisture (percentage)

Initially if there is no plant, all categories will read as “no information yet”. Users have a few options to make a plant on the website and get its information, which will be talked about in the next sections.


Selecting a Plant Type from List
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the options that the users can do when creating a new plant on the website is selecting a plant type from the list. All users have to do is give it a name, give their email address, and select a type of plant from the list. The options, which are some of the most common household plants, are Snake Plant, Peace Lily, Fiddle Leaf Fig, Philodendron, ZZ Plant, Pothos, Majesty Palm, Aloe, and Senecio. By selecting one of these plants from the list, users don’t have to manually input any other information. After pressing submit, users will be able to see all of the plant’s information on the website. 


Adding a New Plant Type
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the other options that the users can do when creating a new plant is manually inputting all of its information. This is the option to do when a plant that the user wants to keep track of isn’t one of the options present from the list. Users will input its name, type, owner, sunlight intensity, hours of sunlight needed, ideal temperature, and ideal soil moisture. After pressing submit, users will be able to see all of the plant’s information on the website.

Getting Information of an Existing Plant
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If users want to get information about a plant that they have already created in the past, there is an option on the website to input the plant’s name and the user’s email. After pressing submit, the plant’s information will appear on the website. This option is good for users that have more than one plant because they can easily switch back and forth on getting a plant’s information and current conditions (which will be talked about in the next section) by just inputting the name that they gave the plant. 

Current Conditions & Sampling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On our website, users will be able to view the current conditions of their plant. These current conditions include:

* Sunlight collected (in foot-candles hours) 
* Temperature (in Celsius)
* Soil moisture (percentage)

Initially, all categories will read as “no readings yet”. Users can press the “start new sampling” button in order to get readings. The sampling period is 24 hours, so once the period ends, the current conditions will display with the current conditions of the user’s plant. For testing purposes though, we did not make the whole sampling period 24 hours, but a minute. 


To Do
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a sampling period is over, there will be a to-do list that appears on the website, notifying users on what they should do to better their plant’s health. Specifically, it will notify users about what they need to do in terms of the plant’s temperature, sunlight exposure, and soil moisture. All the possible options for each conditions are listed below:

* Your plant is too hot! :(
* Your plant is too cold! :(
* Your plant is just the right temperature :)
* Your plant needs more sunlight! :(
* Your plant needs less sunlight! :(
* Your plant is getting enough sunlight :)
* Water your plant! :(
* Your plant is overwatered! :(
* Your plant is getting enough water :)

![Wiring Part 2](./images/wiring2.png)
In the images above, you can see that we have our components wired up and ready for use. We have the LCD screen connected directly without a PWM channel as we did in a previous lab. We also have a button wired to pin 45 as in previous labs. We also have a photoresistor in series with a 20kOhm resistor for the purposes of getting the voltage using a voltage divider, and reading it on pin 3. Additionally, we picked up a new type of sensor, a soil moisture sensor, which uses a power pin and a ground pin as normal, and connected it to pin 5. This simply reads a value ranging from 0 to 2^n where n is the analogResolution so that we could easily convert it into separable ranges for soil moisture. Finally, we have the temperature and pressure sensor that we used in previous labs. Using the schematic, we matched all the necessary wires to get good readings.

Design Challenges and Decisions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some challenges in this project included:
* making ESP32 responsive from button press on website
* implementing a webscraper to scrape ideal conditions on different plants


### Connecting ESP32 with Website
The ESP32 is connected to the website by the server.py file and usage of the plant_reading and plant_sampling databases. POST requests are made to the plant_sampling database by the website, and the ESP32 uses a GET request on the same database to recognize the start of a new sampling period. The inverse is done on the plant_reading database. The ESP32 POSTs raw data to the plant_reading database, which the server.py file will then utilize to perform plant logic, produce a message for the user, then make available to the website by way of a GET request.

### Webscraper
One of the things we wanted for our design was a list in which users could select a plant from. Those plants would already have ideal sunlight, temperature, and moisture levels associated with them, so users didn’t have to manually input it. We planned on doing this by webscraping a plant website, since there were no available APIs that did that. However, webscraping was not taught about in class and nobody on the team knew how to do it. Regardless, we managed to figure it out during the Week 2 Milestone. In the end though, we decided not to use the data from the webscraper and instead we hard coded a few of the most common household plants. There was just too many plants in the database (over 1500) and it lacked temperature ranges for the plant, so we would have had to webscrape another page and join the two together. The soil and moisture readings also were different than how we processed ours, so it just didn’t work out. The webscraper code isn't part of the final code, but can be found below:

**********************************************************

### final.ino - Sampling
A “sampling period” represents a 24 hour period in which data of all types is gathered about the plant’s conditions. The data is gathered over a day so as to be holistic, accounting for the entire day-to-day life of the plant. A sample of sunlight, temperature, and moisture is taken every 30 minutes for the entire 24 hour period utilizing the analog sensors described earlier.



### final.ino - Signal Processing
As described in the sampling section, we will have a sampling period of 24 hours consisting of samples gathered every 30 minutes for a total of 48 samples. For temperature, we just utilize the BMP280 libraries to retrieve the temperature in Celsius, then add to a running sum of temperature across the sampling period. At the end of the sampling period, this value is divided by 48 so as to get the average temperature that the plant experiences. The soil moisture sensor is implemented in the same way, with the only difference being the way in which we retrieve the individual sample values. For the moisture sensor, we get the 12-bit analog reading then linearly map to a moisture percentage between 0 and 100. 0 being dry air and 100 being completely saturated soil (waterlogged soil). The sunlight sensing is done in an alternative manner. This is because the sunlight quantity is a summation rather than an average. The averaging is done at the individual sample level, as the photoresistor is the most sensitive sensor on the ESP32. An averaging filter of the 50th order is used for the sunlight sensor, so as to ensure that no statistical outliers affect the data too greatly. Taking the sample and averaging across 50 values takes less than a second. This sample is also added to a running sum of sunlight gathered, but at the end of the total sampling period, it is divided by two to account for the two samples that are taken per hour (our sunlight readings on the server are quantized by hour). All of these values are then POSTed to the server.


### final.ino - GET & POST requests
The GET and POST requests that are made by the ESP32 are the means of communication with the server. The GET request is run every loop and used to enable near-immediate interaction between the website and the ESP32. The response from the server to the ESP32’s GET request will indicate whether a new sampling period should start. The POST request from the ESP32 is performed at the end of a sampling period, and is not repeated until the end of the next sampling period. The POST request is the method by which raw sensor data from the Plant Buddy is sent to the server.


### support_functions.ino

Support functions for running GET and POST requests on final.ino.

**********************************************************

### server.py - Selecting a plant type from list 
On our HTML page, users can select a plant from a list containing a few of the most common household plants. When they press submit button on the page, it will send a POST request to the server, collecting information about the user’s email, the plant’s name, and one of the plant types from the list. Depending on the plant type, the sunlight, temperature, and moisture levels will be set. It creates plant.db and plant_sampling.db if it doesn’t exist and then inserts values into the database. The values that are inserted into these databases are specified a few sections below.

### server.py - Adding a new plant type
If a plant the user is looking for is not on the list, users can add a new type by manually inputting plant name, plant type, user email, sunlight intensity, hours of sunlight, ideal temperature, and soil moisture percentage and pressing submit on the HTML page to send a POST request to the server. Adding a new plant type will essentially follows the same procedure as selecting a plant type from a list but in this case the sunlight, temperature, and moisture levels are set by the user instead of automatically being set on the server. 

### server.py - Getting information from an existing plant
Users can get information about an existing plant from plant.db by inputting the plant’s name and user email and then pressing submit. This will send a GET request to the server, which will look into the plant.db database with the plant’s name and user email that was inputted from the HTML page.

### server.py - Starting new sampling period
In order to start a new sampling period on the ESP32, a POST request is sent to the server by the website through an HTML form. The only fields for this request are the plant and user names, which the server will then use to increment the corresponding counter value in the plant_sampling database table. The ESP32, which is constantly running a GET request to the server, will use this increase in counter value as an indicator to start a new sampling period.


### server.py - Plant Logic
There is a function in the server, do_plant_logic, with the parameters plant and user, that compares the inputted values from plant.db with the sensor readings from plant_sampling.db whenever a sampling period is requested. It will return a message about the plant's temperature, sunlight, and moisture depending on the differences between the inputted values and the readings. For temperature, the ideal range is within 5 degrees Celsius. If it’s below that then the message will be “Your plant is too cold! :(“ and if it’s more than that then the message will be “Your plant is too hot! :(“. The other readings follow the same procedure, except the range for sunlight is 500 foot candles hours and the range for moisture is 10 percent. In addition, sunlight is calculated in this function by multiplying sunlight hours (inputted by the user) by sunlight intensity. Low, medium, and high sunlight intensity in our code corresponds to 50, 300, and 750 foot candles, respectively.

### plantPage.html
Contains the HTML code for our page.

### plantPage.css 
Contains Cascading Styling Sheet (CSS) used by our HTML page.

### plant.db 

This database contains information about each plant with the following information:

* `plant`: a name given to the plant manually inputted by the user
* `type`:  type of plant, either manually inputted by the user or selected from a list
* `user`: email of the user manually inputted by the user
* `sunlight_intensity`: the ideal sunlight intensity for the plant, either manually inputted from the user or automatically given if the user selects a plant type from the list
* `sunlight_hours`: the ideal sunlight hours for the plant, either manually inputted from the user or automatically given if the user selects a plant type from the list
* `temperature`: the ideal temperature for the plant, either manually inputted from the user or automatically given if the user selects a plant type from the list
* `moisture`: the ideal moisture for the plant, either manually inputted from the user or automatically given if the user selects a plant type from the list

For example:

| plant |            type            | user |         sunlight_intensity        |            sunlight_hours        |  temperature       |        moisture       |
|:--:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Bob |       Fern      |     timmyd@mit.edu    | Low | 10 | 20 | 40 |
| Bobbie | Snake Plant |       alexplantbuddy608@gmail.com      | Medium | 8 | 25 | 40 |

### plant_reading.db  

This database contains information on a plant's current conditions with readings from sensors on the ESP32 side. 

* `plant`: a name given to the plant manually inputted by the user
* `type`:  type of plant, either manually inputted by the user or selected from a list
* `user`: email of the user manually inputted by the user
* `sunlight_reading`: sunlight reading using a sensor sent from ESP32
* `temperature_reading`: temperature reading using a sensor sent from ESP32
* `moisture_reading`, moisture reading using a sensor sent from ESP32

For example:

| plant |            type            | user |         sunlight_reading         |       temperature_reading       | moisture_reading |
|:--:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------:| :----------------:|
| Bob |       Fern      |     timmyd@mit.edu    | 2000 | 23 | 40 |
| Bobbie | Snake Plant |       alexplantbuddy608@gmail.com      | 2000 | 22 | 60 |


### plant_sampling.db   

This database contains information on a plant's name and its user. The ESP32 runs GET requests to the server, checking to see if counter for a plant has changed or not. If it does change, then it runs a sampling period.

* `plant`: a name given to the plant manually inputted by the user
* `user`: email of the user manually inputted by the user
* `counter`: an integer which will be incremented by 1 when sampling period is requested on the website


For example:

| plant |            user            | counter |    
|:--:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Bob |       timmyd@mit.edu      |     3    | 
| Bobbie | alexplantbuddy608@gmail.com  |       5      | 



Milestone Contributions
===============================================================================


## Week 1

The photoresistor, temperature/pressure sensors, moisture sensor, and other hardware components were wired, which was obviously vital to the functionality of the project. The basic structure of the website and database were separately created, later to be integrated so users could have some way of interacting with the project. The server was also set up, so essentially, week 1 was spent setting up some basic structures that can be built upon and integrated with each other in weeks to come.

## Week 2

The sensors were connected last week, and this week, they were translated into values with real-life meanings. Then, it was time for integration. The web interface and server were integrated so as to successfully receive and insert data from the user to the database, which was of course important to the actual ability of the system to remember the plants that users entered. To get data on plants (so we can know how a plant should be treated), we scraped a website with plant information and consolidated the data for later use.

## Week 3

This week, the ESP32 state machine was cleaned up to handle situations where there was no plant, as well as monitoring and idle states. The sensor work had been divided previously amongst members, so it was also important to combine that work onto one machine. The web interface was finalized to display current conditions of a plant, and most importantly, the data acquired in the previous week, the server, the database, and the ESP32/sensors were all integrated. We also began to work on a script that would notify users if a plant needed to be watered, moving forward into the real user-catered function of this project.

## Week 4

To simplify the user experience, we manually categorized the moisture levels. We also manually added some common household plants to the database. More importantly, the website was updated to be more aesthetically pleasing and to start a sampling process after prompting. We added the feature of being able to see how the plant was doing based on a smiley or sad face on the LCD, and finally, confirmed that the project worked on other devices by creating it again on another ESP.
